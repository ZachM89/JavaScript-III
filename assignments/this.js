/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding: This in global scope refers to the window you are in. Outside of any functions.
* 2. Umplicit Binding: Whenever a function is called by a preceeding dot, the object before that dot is this. I am not sure how to reword this so I will just write a stream of consciousness for a second. When you call
    a function from an object, if you say dog.speak(), then all the variables inside the function speak() that are preceeded with 'this.' (this.fur, this.tail, etc) they are referring to dog.
* 3. New Binding: When using a constructor, this refers to the property on the object being created.
* 4. Explicit Binding: 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
